        <h2>** HOW TO SPOT A COMMUNIST (1947) **</h2>

        <p>
          The real Communist is not a liberal or a progressive. He believes in Russia first and <span class="top-secret redacted">a Soviet America.</span> He accepts the doctrines of dictatorship as practiced in Russia. And he is prepared to use <span class="top-secret redacted">a dictator’s tactics of lies and violence</span> to realise his ambitions.


        <p>
          Because the whole Communist apparatus is geared to secrecy, it is not always easy to determine just who is a Communist. But whether he is <span class="top-secret redacted">a Party card-holder or a fellow traveler,</span> the American Communist is not like other Americans. To the Communist, everything – his <span class="top-secret redacted">country, his job, his family</span> – take second place to his party duty. <span class="top-secret redacted">Even his sex life</span> is synchronised with the obligations of the [communist] cause…
        </p>

        <p>
          There is no simple definition of <span class="top-secret redacted">an American Communist.</span> However, certain general classifications can be set up. <span class="top-secret redacted">And if either a person or an organisation falls within most of these classifications, that person or organisation can be said to be following the Communists’ lead.</span>
