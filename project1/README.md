ARTIST STATEMENT:

BASED ON THE 2008 HORROR/THRILLER THE STRANGERS, THIS GAME (THE STRANGERS: LAST NIGHT) PUTS YOU IN THE ROLE OF ONE OF THE KILLERS. IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT, YOU MUST BREAK INTO A HOME THROUGH SOME PATHWAY AND ‘DISPATCH’ ALL THE UNASSUMING FOLKS INSIDE. HOWEVER, BE SURE TO STAY OUT OF THEIR RANGE OF VISION OTHERWISE IT’S GAME OVER.

	THIS PROJECT ENDED UP TAKING A BIT OF A CHANGE PART WAY THROUGH IN TERMS OF WHERE MY FOCUS ENDED UP GOING. THOUGH I’M STILL WORKING ON DEVELOPING MY ENGINE DESIGNS, I FOUND THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES OF NOT DETECTING THE PLAYER THROUGH WALLS OFFERED A CHALLENGING MATH EXPERIENCE. TO DO THIS I HAD TO DEVELOP A SORT OF FAUX RAY TRACING ELEMENT THE CONSTANTLY CHECKS IF THERE ARE ANY WALLS BETWEEN THE PLAYER AND THE VICTIMS.

	NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE 20 PAGES OF MATH NOTES I SCRIBBLED ON AT MY COMPUTER TOOK ME LONGER TO WORK THROUGH THAN THE ACTUAL PROGRAM.
	AS FOR THE GAMEPLAY, I ORIGINALLY WANTED TO HAVE THE PLAYER TRYING TO SNEAK OUT OF THE HOUSE WITHOUT DETECTION, BUT I FOUND I DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE FEATURES THAT WOULD HAVE LED TO A FUN EXPERIENCE. IF I HAD MORE TIME, I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO ADD DOORS, TRAPS, AND EVEN LOCK PICKING OPTIONS TO GIVE THE PLAYER MORE OBSTACLES. EVEN SOMETHING LIKE ADJUSTING THE LIGHTS INSIDE TO MODIFY FOV FOR THE ENEMIES WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA BUT ALAS, TIME ONCE AGAIN GOT THE BEST OF ME.

	WHEN IT CAME TO THE VISUALS, I TRIED PUSHING MYSELF TO TRY NEW DRAWING TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS BLENDING PIXEL ART CHARACTERS WITH A DIGITALLY DESIGNED WORLD. EVEN THE OPENING THEME SONG WAS A NEW ENDEAVOUR AS I MADE IT USING LIVE RECORDINGS I MADE IN MY APARTMENT WITH A VIOLIN, PIANO, AND A HEAVILY DISTORTED DISHWASHER.

	ALL IN ALL, I REALLY ENJOYED HOW THIS TURNED OUT AND WHEN I GET THE NEXT OPPURTUNITY, I’D LOVE TO BUILD ON THIS WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT ENDED UP ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR.
